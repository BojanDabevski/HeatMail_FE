            <h2>About HeatMail</h2>
            <p>The diploma thesis will cover the development of a web application for mass sending of electronic mail. Many businesses have certain information they want to send to their users, but they do not have a tool to do so. The goal of the thesis is to create a solution that will allow messages to be sent to a large number of users in a simple way. With this web application, the user will be able to enter data they want to send to their clients, and then the system will ensure that the users receive it, regardless of whether the user wants to send information about invoices, advertising materials, or some promotions. The system will have the ability to serve different users for different needs</p>
